COMMIT MESSAGES
===============

 - Commit messages should be of the form (the five lines between the
   lines starting with ===)

=== begin example commit ===
short explanation of the commit

Longer explanation explaining exactly what's changed, whether any
external or private interfaces changed, what bugs were fixed (with bug
tracker reference if applicable) and so forth. Be concise but not too brief.
=== end example commit ===

 - Always add a brief description of the commit to the _first_ line of
   the commit and terminate by two newlines (it will work without the
   second newline, but that is not nice for the interfaces).

 - First line (the brief description) must only be one sentence and
   must not start with a capital letter. Don't use a trailing period
   either. Don't exceed 76 characters.

 - The main description (the body) is normal prose and should use normal
   punctuation and capital letters where appropriate. Normally, for patches
   sent to a mailing list it's copied from there.

 - When committing code on behalf of others use the --author option, e.g.
   git commit -a --author "Joe Coder <joe@coder.org>" and --signoff.
